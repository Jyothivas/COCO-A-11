So alert(..) and console.log(..) are not defined by JS. But they look like JS. They are functions and object methods and they obey JS syntax rules. The behaviors behind them are controlled by the environment running the JS engine, but on the surface they definitely have to abide by JS to be able to play in the JS playground.

Most of the cross-browser differences people complain about with "JS is so inconsistent!" claims are actually due to differences in how those environment behaviors work, not in how the JS itself works.
